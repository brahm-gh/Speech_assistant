# How to install required packages

1. (Recommended) Activate your virtual environment. If you have no environment [create one](https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/environment-set-up).
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Remember always to have your environment folder listed in the `.gitignore` file.
